## Question 1.1
We know that an attack to a homebanking server of a bank as greater impact that an attack to a domestic PC. Also, the threat level is higher for the homebanking server of a bank than for the domestic PC. Taking into account the formula to calculate risk we know that the homebanking server of a bank as a higher risk than the domestic PC

## Question 2.1
The fase in the Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle where GRDP should be taken into account is the requirements fase, where the security requirements are identified, especially the GRDP has to be taken into account in the security policies.

## Question 2.2
Regarding the secure in development and support processes topic we can conclude that there are some rules concerning secure development policies, system change control procedures, technical review of aplications after operating platform changes, restrictions on changes to software packages, secure system engineering principles, secure development environment, outsourced development, system security testing and system acceptance testing that should be taken into account so that we can ensure that information security is designed and implemented within our project. Until now we didn't follow this rules, from now on we can integrate this rules in the development of our projects.<br/>

The other topic is cryptographic controls. It's objective is to ensure proper and effective use of cryptography to protect the confidentiality, authenticity and/or integrity of information. To achieve this objective the document gives implementation guidance concerning policy on the use of cryptographic controls and key management. Similar to the previous topic, from now on we will be more thorough regarding the information we manage during our projects and to make that possible we will follow the guidance in the document.


## Question 3.1
1. Education and Guidance - 0,70 
2. Strategy Metrics - 0,67 
3. Security Requirements - 2,10

### Question 3.2 and 3.3
Concerning Security Requirements the team is satisfied although it can be improved. 
Regarding the first two practices we want to acheive at least the same maturity as the later.
