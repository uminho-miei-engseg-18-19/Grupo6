## Question 1.1

### The Data Security Principle 

To protect data, the data security principle requires the implementation of the appropriate technical or organisational measures when processing personal data.
When implementing such measures the controller and the processor should take into account requirements, the cost of implementation and the circumstances of processing, as well as the risks. Some of the measures could include, for example, pseudonymising and encryptyng personal data.<br/>


Pseudonymising refers to replacing attributtes, which make it possible to identify the subject, with a pseudonym, and keeping those atributtes separate. We need to take into account that the pseudonymisation method can affect the effectiveness of data protection. It also funtions as an important element when implementing privacy by design. <br/>

The GDPR mentions that pseudonymisation is an example of appropriate measure that controllers should implement, consequently meetting the requirements of the regulation and protecting the rights of the data subject when processing their data.<br/>

Other examples of appropriate security measures incluce holding data in a secure physical environment, limiting access control via layered logind and protecting the communication of the data with strong criptography.<br/>

Several aditional examples of apropriate safeguards are provided by the Explanatory Report of Modernised Convention 108, this examples include the implementation of a professional secrecy obligation, or the adoption of qualified technical security measures such as data encryption. When implementing specific security measures the controller or the processor should take in account several elements for example nature and volume of the data, adverse consequences for subjects, the need for restricted data access. The latest security methods and technique for data processing must be considered during implementation of the appropriate security measures, as well as the cost of such measures must be proportionate to the risks involved. This measures must be regularly reviewed and updated as necessary.
<br/>

When a pesonal data breach happens, the controller has to notify the competent supervisory authority, without undue delay. When the breach is likely to result in a high risk to a subject's rights and freedoms, the breach has to be communicated to the subject. This communications have to be simple terms. Only in certain situations, such as when the data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the natural person, or securtiy measures render the data unintelligible, may the communication not happen.



## Question 1.2
### Data Protection by default

The best practice in data protection have some criteria to be discuss which are minimum amount of personal data, minimum extent of the processing of personal data, minimum period of storage of personal data and minimum accessibility of personal data. All this criteria need to be take into account in all-around the approach.<br/>
The first criteria is minimum amount of personal data. The collection of less data is better which is also a well-known security principle. The next point is granular collection of data on the basis of necessity, which means only collecting necessary data depending on the context. Furthermore, it also discuss the increasing of privacy using technology that minimizes the risk on sensitive data. All this action may reduce the temporary copies or tranfer of data. <br/>
The second criterion is minimum extent of the processing of the data. In practice less processing, the better, to reduce the risk for the rights and freedoms of a person. This means data can still be processed but minimizing the risks for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. The user empowering tools is the limitation of the extent of the processing which is closely interlinked with the provision by the controller of proper tools, which the data subjects can use to exercise their rights. <br/>
The third criterion is minimum period of the storage of the personal data. The shorter the storage the better this means period storage for personal data needs to be minimised. Permanent storage sometimes does not have any significant purpose but sometimes it needs to be stored and  after some time needs to be erased. <br/>
The final criterion is minimum accessibility of the personal data. Restricting access on the basis of necessity, this relates to access policy and control, which should be designed by the controller on the basis of the need-to-know principle. Limiting ways of sharing; the different possible ways of data sharing should be assessed and, wherever possible, minimised by the controller. No public by default without active intervention; this focus on preventing personal data from being made public by default. <br/>
In conclusion, this four criteria are important criteria for enhancing usability in systems and application by allowing simple use, contributing for user-friendly systems. <br/>

## Question 1.3
### 1.

The nine criteria are the following:
1. __Evaluation or scoring__
	In particularly by profiling and predicting from previously gathered data.<br/>

2. __Automated-decision making with legal or similar significant effecct__
	Processing that aims at taking decisions on data that can result in "legal effects concerning the natural person" or "similary significantly affects the natural person".<br/>

3. __Systematic monitoring__
	Type of processing used to observe, monitor or control data subjects, including data collected through networks. This kind of monitoring is something to be cautious because the personal data may be collected without the awareness of the data subjects. Making them without knowing who is collecting the data and what they will do with it.<br/>

4. __Sensitive data or data of highly personal nature__
	This concerns to the personal data that, depending where are you from, may be more sensitive like your political or religious ideology.<br/>

5. __Data processed on a large scale__
	The *GDPR* does not define what is large-scale, but the WP29 recommends that factors, like the number of data subjects and the volume and time of processing of the data  , be considered when determining whether the processing is taken on a large-scale or not.<br/>	

6. __Matching or combining datasets__
	Two or more data processing operations performed for different purposes and by different controllers in a way that would exceed the expectations of data subjects.<br/>

7. __Data concerning vulnerable data subjects__
	Data from high-ranking subjects of "the real world" is considered vulnerable data and must be carefully handled.<br/> 

8. __Innovative use or applying new technological or organisational solutions__
	Handling data with new and innovative technologies like	taking advantage of finger printing and/or facial recognition.<br/>

9. This last criteria includes processing operations that aims at allowing, modifying or refusing data subjects access to a service or entry into a contract.<br/>  		
 
### 2.
The project is a streaming application for movies and series. The kind of information that will be processed is usernames, passwords, e-mails, payment information, user's preferences and data collected from user's choices. <br/>
The processing of this data satisfies the following criteria: <br/>
- Evaluation or scoring as well as Systematic monitoring, since we collect data from user's preferences and choices to predict what they may like, so we can present to them in the future;
- Sensitive data or data of highly personal nature, considering that we collect user's preferences, we have in our possession data that may be of personal nature regarding the user.
